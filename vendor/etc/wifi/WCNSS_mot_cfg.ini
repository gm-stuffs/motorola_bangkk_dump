# This file allows user to override the qcom

# Minimum RSSI value of the candidate AP to consider it as candidate
# for 2G to 5G roam.
# Default: -70
#
# In our 1db tests, the throughput of 5G is usually much higher than 2G even the RSSI
# is lower than -75dBm. In order to balance the throughput and the connection stability,
# We set this value to -72
min_rssi_for_2g_to_5g_roam=-72

# This is used to control the RSSI threshold for neighbor lookup.
# [ROAM_TRIGGER] LOW RSSI for 2G
# Default: 78
gNeighborLookupThreshold=73

# roam_bg_scan_bad_rssi_thresh - RSSI threshold for background roam
# If the DUT is connected to an AP with weak signal, then the bad RSSI
# from other scan clients and try to roam if there is a better AP
# available in the environment.
# Default: -76
#
# Since it depends the scan results from other scan clients instead of triggering a roaming
# scan, it won't bring additional power consumption.
# We set it to -65 because our full signal strength threshold is 65dBm
roam_bg_scan_bad_rssi_thresh=-65

# roam_bad_rssi_thresh_offset_2g - RSSI threshold offset for 2G to 5G roam
# If the DUT is connected to an AP with weak signal in 2G band, then the
# bad RSSI offset for 2g would be used as offset from the bad RSSI
# threshold configured and then use the resulting rssi for an opportunity
# to use the scan results from other scan clients and try to roam to
# 5G Band ONLY if there is a better AP available in the environment.
# For example if the roam_bg_scan_bad_rssi_thresh is -76 and
# roam_bad_rssi_thresh_offset_2g is 40 then the difference of -36 would be
# used as a trigger to roam to a 5G AP if DUT initially connected to a 2G AP
# Default: 40
roam_bad_rssi_thresh_offset_2g=30

# This ini is used to set the 5G band lookup threshold for roaming.
# It depends on another INI which is gNeighborLookupThreshold.
# gNeighborLookupThreshold is a legacy INI item which will be used to
# set the RSSI lookup threshold for both 2G and 5G bands. If the
# user wants to setup a different threshold for a 5G band, then user
# can use this offset value which will be summed up to the value of
# gNeighborLookupThreshold and used for 5G
# e.g: gNeighborLookupThreshold = -76dBm
#      lookup_threshold_5g_offset = 6dBm
#      Then the 5G band will be configured to -76+6 = -70dBm
# Default: 0
#
# [ROAM_TRIGGER] LOW RSSI for 5G
lookup_threshold_5g_offset=3

# This INI is used to decide whether to Roam or not based on RSSI. AP1 is the
# currently associated AP and AP2 is chosen for roaming. The Roaming will
# happen only if AP2 has better Signal Quality and it has a RSSI better than
# AP2. RoamRssiDiff is the number of units (typically measured in dB) AP2
# is better than AP1
# Default: 5
RoamRssiDiff=3

# Enable/disable the host silent recovery
# 0: Disabled
# 1: Enabled
